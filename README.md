# NexTask

NexTask is an app for managing personal tasks.

## How to run:

1. Make sure you have [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed. If not, do it by clicking on
   the link.
2. Clone this repository. On your terminal, run:
   `git clone https://github.com/eduardobandeiramg/nex-task.git`
3. Open the project inside an IDE (
   preferably [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio?hl=pt-br)).
4. Run the following command at the root of the project:
   `flutter pub get`
5. Open any android phone emulator you wish (to test on an iOS device, you should use a physical
   device connected to a mac. It is due to an issue on
   the [image_picker package](https://pub.dev/packages/image_picker), declared on it's documentation).
6. Execute the project by tapping the 'run' button once the emulator is fully initialized.
